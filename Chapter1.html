    Another year passes the man comes home from work to find his house on fire yet again, he sees the little green man again and begins to chase him. The little green man runs and then gets in his car. The man being more prepared this time gets in his car too and drives after him. But the little green man then drives to the airport, jumps on a plane and get away.
