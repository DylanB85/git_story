<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<p>The man looks around the airport and find the little green man getting on the plane. So the man gets on the plane and follows.
The man tries to run after the little green but he leaves the airport and gets the last taxi available out of the airport.
The man curses the little green man. He has been foiled again</p>
<br>
<p>The man spends the next year paranoid, trying to devise a plan on how he can stop this madness and end the little green mans arson.<br>
So he thinks and traces everything the little green man does. He remembers every step he takes to get away and books everything in advance for the same day next year,
    so that the little green man cannot possibly get away this time.</p>
