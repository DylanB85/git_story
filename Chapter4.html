He then travelled to he gets a taxi back to the airport. He takes the plane back to his hometown filled with guilt.</p>

<p>The man lands in his hometown. He gets in his car and drives back home. He again finds his house on fire wondering why
is this happening? He sees the little green man again he goes to chase him and he runs away. Too tired to even try anymore the man just lets him
away this time.</p>

<p>So the man decides that his best plan of action is to just move house and he will be done of this entire ordeal. The
man moves houses immediately and then another year passes. No fires! "Huh, maybe that worked" the man says to himself.</p>

<p>One more year passes and the man sees his new house on fire! He sees the little green man again. Enough is enough, the man has had
it up to here with this nonsense. He doesn't chase the green man as he knows he will just run away. But he screams at him
"You told me you didn't burn my house down!" The little green man replies with "Yeah...I lied...what else was I supposed to do"</p>
