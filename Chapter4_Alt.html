<h1>Chapter 4 Alternate Ending</h1>
<p>So after realising his mistake, the man puts the little green man down and apologises. He leaves the island as quickly as possible and full of guilt.
He gets on his boat and heads back to the mainland. Once he reaches the mainland he hails a taxi and gets a taxi back to
the airport. He then gets on a plane back to his hometown filled with guilt.</p>

<p>The mans plane then lands in his hometown and he drives home. He sees his house in perfect condition but decides that it would be much safer if he just moved.
So the man moves to the next town over hoping to avoid these fires for good. One year passes and the man cannot believe his luck,
no fires! Another year passes and there are no fires again. The man thinks that all his problems are solved.</p>
