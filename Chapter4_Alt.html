<h1>Chapter 4 Alternate Ending</h1>
<p>So after realising his mistake, the man puts the little green man down and apologises. He leaves the island as quickly as possible and full of guilt.
He gets on his boat and heads back to the mainland. Once he reaches the mainland he hails a taxi and gets a taxi back to
the airport. He then gets on a plane back to his hometown filled with guilt.</p>

<p>The mans plane then lands in his hometown and he drives home. He sees his house in perfect condition but decides that it would be much safer if he just moved.
So the man moves to the next town over hoping to avoid these fires for good. One year passes and the man cannot believe his luck,
no fires! Another year passes and there are no fires again. The man thinks that all his problems are solved.</p>

<p>But the next year the man finds his house on fire again. He immediately suspects that the little green man lied to him.
He gets really angry and travels to the island where the man is from and asks "Why did you lie?" The little green man is confused
and tells him he didn't lie. The man tells him the story the little green man says "Look for the little red man". So when the man goes
home he waits one more year and his house is on fire again and he sees a little red man and asks "Why do you keep burning my house down?".
"Because you were too stupid to realise that it was me and not the little green man". The man then chases the little red man
who hops in his car, drives away and was never seen again</p>
